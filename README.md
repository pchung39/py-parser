# py-parser

## Introduction

The Py-Parser is a robust CSV parser that takes into account various data types, such as integers/floats/strings, as well as evaluating specific functions such as escape keys. I'm currently working on making this work with unicode characters also. The Py-Parser is also an excellent example of a state machine, being also to understand the beginning and end of token regardless of whether the token is wrap in a quote.

## Additional Information

Py-Parser does not use any libraries, besides to stream the data (byte-by-byte), in any of the implementations. This means that every possible tool or available function to assist in making parsing easier, has not been used. 

## Algorithms

Along with the parser itself, I've also added my own versions of several elementary sort & search algorithms.

* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

* Binary Search
* Singly/Doubly Linked Lists
* Binary Tree Search
