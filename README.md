# py-parser

## Introduction

The Py-Parser is my first massive project into the world of programming. The Py-Parser is a robust csv parser that takes into account various data types, such as integers/floats/strings, as well as computing specific functions such as escape keys. I'm currently working on making this work with unicode characters also. The Py-Parser is also an excellent example of a state machine, being also to understand the beginning and end of token regardless of whether the token is wrap in a quote. 

## Algorithms

Along with the parser itself, I've also added my own versions of several elementary sort & search algorithms.

### Bubble Sort
### Merge Sort
### Quick Sort

### Binary Search
### Singly/Doubly Linked Lists
### Binary Tree Search

## Additional Information

One of the intriguing parts of the Py-Parser is that it does not use any libraries, besides to stream the data (byte-by-byte), in any of the implementations. This means that every possible tool or available function to assist in making parsing easier, has not been used.
